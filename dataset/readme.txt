Goetschalckx, M. and C. Jacobs-Blecha (1989. VRPB with Euclidean cost matrix. This approach is based on the concept of Space Filling curves  previously used by Barthodi and Platzaman for the solution of the planar TSP.

Remarks:
 - <node>: attribute type=0 for the depot and 1 for  linehaul customer, and 2 backhaul customer nodes
 - <decimals>: Unfortunately there is no standard rounding rule for this dataset in the literature. Since the VRP-REP format (V.1.0.0) requires a rounding rule we suggest to round the distances to the closest integer value, following the TSPLIB standard. Be aware, however, that this is not necessarily the rounding rule used by the algorithms which delivered the best known solutions for the dataset registered in the VRP-REP platform.
